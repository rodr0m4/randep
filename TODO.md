Write makefile or equivalent in the python world (setup.py? how do big oss project do it?)

Add syntax for --last:
	randep --last 2 (opens the second file from the top: --last 1 == --last)
	randep --last abc.mkv (will try to find abc.mkv in the history file, if not found will finish with error, maybe search for regex?)
